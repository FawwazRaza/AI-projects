# Spam Email Classifier

## Description

The Spam Email Classifier project is designed to identify and filter spam emails using machine learning algorithms. This project applies two popular classifiers—Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machines (SVM)—to classify email messages into spam or ham categories, enhancing email filtering capabilities.

## Technologies Used

- **Libraries and Frameworks:** NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Dataset:** SMS Spam Collection Dataset
- **Other Tools:** `urllib` for dataset download, `zipfile` for dataset extraction

## Features

- **Naive Bayes Classifier:** Utilizes the Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm to predict whether an email is spam or ham.
- **SVM Classifier:** Implements a linear kernel Support Vector Machine to perform email classification.
- **Dynamic Email Classification:** Includes a function to classify new email texts based on the trained models.
- **Performance Evaluation:** Provides accuracy scores and detailed classification reports for model performance assessment.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
